# Moody Notes

This is a personal project. The idea is that the user will write notes down and they'll be able to 
track how they feel by attaching emotions to those notes.
The user can attach up to 72 emotions in total and they are broken down into three categories.
6 main emotions, each with 6 derived emotions, and each with 2 more specific emotions.
